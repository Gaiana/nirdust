NIRDust is a python package that uses K-band (2.2 micrometers) spectra to 
measure the temperature of the dust heated by an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) 
accretion disk. 


## Motivation:

K-band nuclear/circumnuclear spectral continuum of Type 2 AGNs is often composed of two 
components: the stellar population emission and a hot 700 - 1600 K dust component.
If a Reference Spectrum is used to model the stellar emission, the dust component 
can be fitted by a blackbody function in order to obtain its temperature.


## Features

The package provides several functionalities to pre-process spectra and fit the
hot dust component of a AGN K-band spectrum with black body functions. 

NIRDust needs a minimum of two spectra to run: a target one, where the dust 
temperature will be determined, and a reference spectrum, where the emission 
is considered to be purely stellar. The reference spectrum spectrum will be used by
NIRDust to model the stellar emission from the target spectrum. 


Footnote: the hot dust component may or may not be present in your type 2 
nuclei, do not get disappointed if NIRDust finds nothing.


## Requeriments

You will need Python 3.8 or higher to run NIRDust.

## Installation

You can install the least stable version of NIRDust from pip:


``` python
$ pip install nirdust
```

Or, for the develovepment instalation clone this repository and then inside the local directory execute

``` python
$ pip install -e .
```
